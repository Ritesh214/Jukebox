<h2>Jukebox player</h2>
<p>The enhancement plan is to make a music jukebox with albums containing lists of songs which will be associated to a given name. The steps will be as follows:
Clone repository from Bitbucket which is a collaborative development environment.
Create main class that will load the rest of the program.
Create the classes and methods for the albums and students.
Create functions that call student names and get albums associated to their names.
Commit the changes to the repository awaiting code review from fellow collaborators.
The skills illustrated here are software design and engineering specifically on object oriented programming using Java language. Here I will demonstrate the use of functions, function definition and calling functions. I will also show how to create classes and define methods within the class. I will show the use of loops and recursions. The project will demonstrate the ability to collaborate on a project using cloud a repository management system, Bitbucket. The project will also show my mastery in using the eclipse IDE tool to develop projects like the use of its various features and tools.</p>

As shown above, the planned enhancements have been done step by step. This artefact has demonstrated various skills that are relevant to my ePortfolio. These include but are not limited to:
1)Working in collaborative environments using cloud repositories.
2)Using the eclipse IDE and its various tools and features.
3)Programming with Java to create classes, methods and functions.
4)Performing unit tests on projects.
The artefact now has more students, albums and songs. It also has error catching using the try-catch error capturing method in Java. These enhancements meet the objectives as set out and have demonstrated the same.
The process taught me the importance of good documentation that can enable fellow collaborators follow along. I also learnt the importance of well named variables, classes and functions that cannot be mistaken or create confusion when being used. I also learnt that well commented code enables better collaboration when working in a team project. There was a challenge in performing inline stepwise error trapping during runtime but I finally learnt how it’s done.
